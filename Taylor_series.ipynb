        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Taylor Series** is an infinite series that represents a function as a sum of terms calculated from the values of its derivatives at a single point. The Taylor series of a function $f(x)$ around a point $x = a$ is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \\frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \\cdots\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The general form of the Taylor series is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x - a)^n\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $f^{(n)}(a)$ is the $n$-th derivative of $f(x)$ evaluated at $x = a$,\n",
        "- $n!$ is the factorial of $n$,\n",
        "- $x$ is the variable, and\n",
        "- $a$ is the center of expansion.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Convergence**\n",
        "   - The Taylor series converges to the function $f(x)$ at a point if the function is smooth (infinitely differentiable) at that point.\n",
        "   - The radius of convergence determines the interval where the series approximates the function accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Maclaurin Series**\n",
        "   - A **Maclaurin series** is a special case of the Taylor series where $a = 0$.\n",
        "   - The formula for the Maclaurin series is:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \\frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3 + \\cdots\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Remainder or Error Term**\n",
        "   - The remainder term $R_n(x)$ estimates the error when truncating the series at the $n$-th term.\n",
        "   - It is given by:\n",
        "\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "   R_n(x) = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x - a)^{n+1}\n",
        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "   Where $c$ is some value between $a$ and $x$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Application of Taylor Series**\n",
        "   - The Taylor series allows us to approximate complex functions with polynomials.\n",
        "   - It is widely used in numerical analysis, physics, and engineering for solving differential equations, approximating transcendental functions, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Examples of Common Functions\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Exponential Function** $e^x$\n",
        "\n",
        "   The Taylor series of $e^x$ around $x = 0$ (Maclaurin series) is:\n",
        "\n",

        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Cosine Function** $\\cos(x)$\n",

        "   $$\n",
        "\n",
        "## Truncating the Series\n",
        "\n",
        "When using the Taylor series in practice, we often truncate the series after a finite number of terms. The **degree** of the series refers to how many terms are included in the approximation. For example, truncating the Taylor series for $\\sin(x)$ at the 3rd degree gives:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\sin(x) \\approx x - \\frac{x^3}{3!}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",

        "## Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Approximating Functions**: Taylor series allows you to approximate complicated functions by polynomials, which are easier to handle for computation.\n",
        "2. **Solving Differential Equations**: In many cases, Taylor series expansions are used to find approximate solutions to differential equations.\n",
        "3. **Numerical Methods**: Taylor series are foundational in numerical methods, particularly in algorithms like Newton's method.\n",

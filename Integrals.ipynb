        "## What is an Integral?\n",
        "\n",
        "An **integral** is a mathematical operation used to calculate areas under curves, volumes, and other quantities that accumulate or vary continuously. In simple terms, it represents the accumulation of a quantity over a given interval. There are two main types of integrals:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Definite Integral**: Computes the area under a curve within a specified interval.\n",
        "2. **Indefinite Integral**: Represents a general function whose derivative is the integrand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Definite Integral\n",
        "\n",
        "A **definite integral** computes the total accumulation of a function over a specific interval. It is written as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where \\($ f(x) $\\) is the function being integrated, and \\($ [a, b] $\\) is the interval over which we are integrating. The result of a definite integral is a numerical value, representing the net area under the curve between \\($ x = a $\\) and \\($ x = b $\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, the integral of \\($ f(x) = 2x + 1 $\\) from 0 to \\($ \\pi $\\) is:\n",
        "\n",

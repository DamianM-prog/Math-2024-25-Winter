        "\n",
        "In mathematics, the **extremum** refers to the points at which a function reaches either its maximum or minimum value. These points are critical in optimization problems, where we aim to either maximize or minimize a given quantity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Types of Extremum\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Local Maximum**: A point \\($ x = c $\\) is a local maximum of a function \\($ f(x) $\\) if \\($ f(c) \\geq f(x) $\\) for all \\($ x $\\) in some neighborhood around \\($ c $\\). In other words, \\($ f(c) $\\) is larger than or equal to the values of \\($ f(x) $\\) near \\($ c $\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Local Minimum**: A point \\($ x = c $\\) is a local minimum of a function \\($ f(x) $\\) if \\($ f(c) \\leq f(x) $\\) for all \\($ x $\\) in some neighborhood around \\($ c $\\). In other words, \\($ f(c) $\\) is smaller than or equal to the values of \\($ f(x) $\\) near \\($ c $\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Global Maximum**: A point \\($ x = c $\\) is a global maximum of a function \\($ f(x) $\\) if \\($ f(c) \\geq f(x) $\\) for all values of \\($ x $\\) in the domain of the function. The value \\($ f(c) $\\) is the largest value of the function across its entire domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Global Minimum**: A point \\($ x = c $\\) is a global minimum of a function \\($ f(x) $\\) if \\($ f(c) \\leq f(x) $\\) for all values of \\($ x $\\) in the domain of the function. The value \\($ f(c) $\\) is the smallest value of the function across its entire domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Finding Extrema\n",
        "\n",
        "To find the extrema (both local and global) of a function \\($ f(x) $\\), follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Find the first derivative**: Take the derivative of \\($ f(x) $\\) to find \\($ f'(x) $\\). Critical points occur where the first derivative is zero or undefined.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Solve \\($ f'(x) = 0 $\\)**: Set the first derivative equal to zero and solve for \\($ x $\\). These are the critical points, where the function may have a local extremum.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Use the second derivative test (optional)**:\n",
        "   - If \\($ f''(x) > 0 $\\) at a critical point \\($ x = c $\\), then \\($ f(c) $\\) is a local minimum.\n",
        "   - If \\($ f''(x) < 0 $\\) at a critical point \\($ x = c $\\), then \\($ f(c) $\\) is a local maximum.\n",
        "   - If \\($ f''(x) = 0 $\\), the second derivative test is inconclusive, and you may need to use other methods (such as the first derivative test).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Check endpoints (if applicable)**: For a function with a restricted domain, check the function's values at the endpoints of the domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example\n",
        "\n",
        "For the function \\($ f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 5 $\\), we want to find the extrema:\n",
        "\n",

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "An **extremum** can either be a **maximum** or **minimum** depending on whether the function reaches a peak or a trough at that point. The process of finding extrema involves differentiating the function, solving for critical points, and using tests to classify those points as maxima or minima.\n"

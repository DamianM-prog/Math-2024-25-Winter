        "\n",
        "## 1. **Finding Limits**\n",
        "\n",
        "When solving limit problems, the method depends on the type of limit you're evaluating. Below are common types of limits with general steps for solving them.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Limit at Infinity:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a rational function:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[$\n",
        "\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\n",
        "$\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "Where \\($P(x)$\\) and \\($Q(x)$\\) are polynomials.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Solve:\n",
        "- **Identify the highest degree terms** in both the numerator \\($P(x)$\\) and the denominator \\($Q(x)$\\).\n",
        "- Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of \\(x\\) in the denominator.\n",
        "- Simplify the expression, and evaluate the limit as \\($x \\to \\infty$\\).\n",
        "- The limit will often be determined by the ratio of the highest degree terms in the numerator and denominator.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Special Cases:\n",
        "- **Degree of numerator < degree of denominator**: The limit will be 0.\n",
        "- **Degree of numerator = degree of denominator**: The limit is the ratio of the leading coefficients.\n",
        "- **Degree of numerator > degree of denominator**: The limit is \\($ \\infty $\\) or \\($ -\\infty $\\), depending on the signs of the leading terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Limit at a Point (e.g., \\($x \\to a$\\))**:\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a function \\(f(x)\\), you can evaluate the limit by direct substitution:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[$\n",
        "\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x)\n",
        "$\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Solve:\n",
        "- **Direct substitution**: Try to substitute \\(x = a\\) directly into the function. If the result is a defined number, that is the limit.\n",
        "- If you encounter an indeterminate form like \\($ \\frac{0}{0} $\\), use **algebraic manipulation** such as factoring, simplifying, or rationalizing the expression.\n",
        "- **L'H么pital's Rule**: If you still get an indeterminate form like \\($ \\frac{0}{0} $\\) or \\($ \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty} $\\), apply L'H么pital's Rule. Differentiate the numerator and denominator separately, and then re-evaluate the limit.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Trigonometric Limits:\n",
        "- For small angles, remember the standard limit:\n",
        "  \\[$\n",
        "  \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = 1\n",

        "\n",
        "## 2. **Finding Asymptotes**\n",
        "\n",
        "Asymptotes are lines that a function approaches but never quite reaches. There are two main types: **vertical asymptotes** and **horizontal asymptotes**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Vertical Asymptotes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A vertical asymptote occurs where the function goes to \\($ \\infty $\\) or \\($ -\\infty $\\) as \\(x\\) approaches a particular value.\n",

        "f(x) = \\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\n",
        "$\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Solve:\n",
        "1. **Set the denominator equal to zero**: Solve \\($Q(x) = 0$\\). The values of \\(x\\) that make the denominator zero (but not the numerator) are potential vertical asymptotes.\n",
        "2. **Check the behavior**: Ensure the numerator doesn't also become zero at the same point. If it does, the limit might be indeterminate and you should factor to simplify.\n",
        "3. **Check the behavior as \\(x\\) approaches these points**: As \\(x\\) approaches the critical value from both sides, if \\($f(x)$\\) goes to \\($ \\infty $\\) or \\($ -\\infty $\\), then there is a vertical asymptote at that point.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Horizontal Asymptotes:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Horizontal asymptotes describe the behavior of the function as \\($x \\to \\infty$\\) or \\($x \\to -\\infty$\\).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps to Solve:\n",
        "- **For rational functions**:\n",
        "  - If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\(y = 0\\).\n",
        "  - If the degree of the numerator equals the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \\($y = \\frac{a}{b}$\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator, respectively.\n",
        "  - If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is **no horizontal asymptote** (the function goes to \\($ \\infty $\\) or \\($ -\\infty $\\)).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **For non-rational functions** (like trigonometric functions):\n",
        "  - For functions like \\($ \\sin(x) $\\), \\($ \\cos(x) $\\), or other bounded functions in the numerator, the behavior as \\($x \\to \\infty$\\) or \\($x \\to -\\infty$\\) will often lead the function to approach 0 when the denominator grows without bound.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  \\[$\n",
        "  \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x^2 + 1} = 0\n",
        "  $\\]\n",
        "  because the denominator grows faster than the numerator oscillates.\n",

        "- **Limits at a Point**: Use direct substitution and algebraic simplification; apply L'H么pital's Rule if necessary.\n",
